    \textbf{Name:} \texttt{curper} -- Set the current sample period.\\
    \textbf{Description:} The \texttt{curper} command sets the time
    between output current samples.  Since the output current
    meausurement is an average of the previous four samples, this
    command also sets the averaging window.  See the \texttt{curout}
    command described \vpageref{cmd:curout} for more information.

    \textbf{Example:}
    \boxtext{\texttt{curper 120} 
      \codecomment{Set the current sample period to 120ms}
    }
