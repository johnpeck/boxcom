* ----------------------- Dated notes ---------------------------
** <2012-10-07 Sun> Created this project
* --------------------- Specifications --------------------------
** USB board
*** Four 3.3V power outputs, one of which has current monitoring up to 100mA
*** 2-pin current monitor output
*** FTDI USB to UART part, with level translator for RS-232 levels
*** Switch header for lighted panel rocker switch
** Power outputs: +3.3V, +/15V at 100mA
** Module name programmable with remote command
** Non-volatile voltage input calibration
* ------------------------ TODO list ----------------------------
* DONE Post to geda-user about gschem issues on apone
** I'm having trouble selecting text, and text isn't redrawn until I explicitly ask for a redraw.
   - I wonder if there's a good way to assess the "state" of the geda installation, so that the developers have a beter idea of what I'm working with.
** TODO Uninstall fonts installed during fix

* DONE Receive eval232r boards
** Ordered from Digi-Key on <2012-10-07 Sun>
   - Scheduled to ship via UPS 3-day
* DONE Create a schematic part for ft232rl
** Part has a 3.3V LDO regulator broken out to pin 17.
   - Can source 50mA.
* DONE Keystone 621 bracket [2/2]
** DONE Schematic part
** DONE Mechanical drawing
* DONE Fix capacitor value for USB power -- make sure Butterfly boots
  - Replaced the 1uF C402 with 3.3nF
* DONE Create a schematic part for trs202e -- rs232 transceiver
** The TI part is trs202ecd for 16-SOIC parts
** DONE Use luciani's SOIC-127P-600L1-16N footprint
* DONE Create schematic parts for eval232 schematic parts
** DONE 10nF capacitor
** DONE Ferrite bead
** DONE 47p capacitor
** DONE 4.7u capacitor

* DONE Create makefile for schematics directory
* DONE Create schematic page for usbio
* DONE Add grounded mounting hole to power schematic.
  - This will be a 4-40 mounting hole with a big "shoulder" for making connections to the chassis.  It should show up in the schematic so a net can be associated with it
** DONE Create fat mounting hole footprint (4_40_mthole_fat.fp)
* DONE Create 3-pin mta100 output symbol
  - Make sure it has a footprint -- don't need a right angle connector for this board.
  - Have to modify 2pin_mta100_pol.fp for 3 pins.
* DONE Create the butterfly board schematic pages
  - The Butterfly is its own board.
* DONE Add feet for budbox to hardware page
* TODO Work on makefile for usb board schematics [4/5]
** DONE kitgen must take the list of schematics from standard input
   - This is the way to use it with a makefile.
** TODO We need a "cost" target to calculate bom cost
** DONE We need a "kit" target to create a kit
** DONE We need an "edit" target to edit all schematic pages
** DONE We need a "netlist" target to create the netlist for PCB
* TODO Work on makefile for butterfly board schematics [1/1]
** DONE Create this makefile
* DONE Improve serial link circuitry [2/2]
** DONE Test points for Rx and Tx lines
** DONE Source resistor for Tx (look at Butterfly's source resistor)
   - Looks like the Butterfly uses a 4.7k RxD termination
* DONE Add lt6106 part
* TODO Add passives around trs202 rs-232 transceiver
* TODO Add budbox to hardware page for usb
* TODO Add notes about using punch for USB jack on USB page
* DONE Add standoffs for mounting butterfly to hardware page
  - These will go on the butterfly board schematics
* TODO Work on functional drawing [1/2]
  - Functional drawing is [[file:implement/drawings/functional.fig][here]].
** DONE Add current monitor
** TODO Use functional drawing to name schematic pages
* TODO Work on mechanical drawing [3/4]
  - Mechanical drawing is [[file:implement/drawings/budbox.fig][here]].
** DONE Create 3-pin mta100 header drawing
** DONE Bring Butterfly drawing from buttcom into doctools
** DONE Make a drawing of the 21-1 rocker switch
** TODO Add mounting holes to butterfly drawing in library
