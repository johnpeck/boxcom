** <2013-02-03 Sun> Rev A of USB board set to Sierra Proto
* --------------------- Specifications --------------------------
** USB board
*** Four 3.3V power outputs, one of which has current monitoring up to 100mA
*** 2-pin current monitor output
*** FTDI USB to UART part, with level translator for RS-232 levels
*** Switch header for lighted panel rocker switch
** Power outputs: +3.3V, +/15V at 100mA
** Module name programmable with remote command
** Non-volatile voltage input calibration
* ------------------------ TODO list ----------------------------
* Work on chassis [6/7]
  - Mechanical drawing is [[file:implement/drawings/budbox.fig][here]].
** DONE Create an end-on view of a USB jack
** TODO Create top-down view of angle bracket
** TODO Finish cutting diagram for back panel
* Work on code
** DONE Switch to correct ADC channel (4)
   - Need to figure out why this isn't reading correctly.  Is it set
     to an output?
** TODO Add log message warning that JTAG has been disabled
   - Add this inside ADC init
* TODO Work on makefile for usb board schematics [6/7]
** DONE We need a "pcb" target to run gsch2pcb
   - This will also need to create the project file.
** DONE kitgen must take the list of schematics from standard input
   - This is the way to use it with a makefile.
** DONE Renumber components on each page
** DONE We need a "kit" target to create a kit
** DONE We need an "edit" target to edit all schematic pages
** DONE We need a "netlist" target to create the netlist for PCB
** TODO Add makefile target to copy assembly list to website
* TODO Work on makefile for butterfly board schematics [1/1]
** DONE Create this makefile
* Work on Butterfly board [8/8]
** DONE Fill kit 16
** DONE Make a drawing in the howto showing connections
*** DONE Show show connection to ADC7 at PF4 (J401 pins 1 and 2) 
** DONE Make a drawing showing how to make the USART cable
   DEADLINE: <2013-03-19 Tue>
** DONE Make a UART cable
   DEADLINE: <2013-03-25 Mon>
** DONE Add power and UART connections to butterfly
   DEADLINE: <2013-03-25 Mon>
** DONE Make power and ADC cables for Butterfly
   DEADLINE: <2013-03-26 Tue>
** DONE Make sure toolchain is installed
** DONE Increase USART baud
* TODO Work on USB board layout [20/23]
** DONE Compare 22 and 25 gauge needle soldering
   DEADLINE: <2013-02-25 Mon>
   - Compare the force needed to draw a line of solder across some SO-16 pins.  I think the problem I'm having with the SSOP-28 part is that I'm trying to draw too fast to thin out the solder line.  Drawing too fast results in leaving gaps in the solder.
** DONE Create assembly plan that lets you test FTDI part before you finish assembly 
** DONE Create makefile target for editing
   - Should include all the command-line options you want
** DONE Decide on board outline
*** <2012-11-27 Tue> Trying 2.5-inch square
*** <2012-11-29 Thu> Decided on 2.5 x 2.75 outline
** DONE Find out if the ft232r part is connected directly to D+ and D-
   - It is.  Look at the ft232r evaluation board schematics.
** DONE Make blog post about multi-line bash commands and their comments
** DONE Place components on rs232io page
** DONE Place components on auxiliary power page
** DONE Place components on monitored power page
** DONE Position and label mta100 connectors
** DONE Decide on where to host schematics and layout for boxcom
   - These will go in a static directorty on the johnpeck site.  See the boxcom.rst draft I've made.
** TODO Add makefile target to copy silkprint over to website
** DONE Add part number and rev code to top silk
** DONE Add ground plane to layout.  I'll make a 4-layer board.
** DONE Route power to ftdi part
** DONE Route power to rs232 transceiver
** DONE Route power to U500 (current monitor)
** DONE Route the U400 and U501 voltage regulators
** DONE Prepare gerber export target for makefile
** DONE Follow checklist.org to check over gerbers output to output directory
** TODO Things to check when the board gets back
*** TODO Did the solder mask make it between pins on U300?
** TODO Make a diagram in xfig showing what each of the numbers mean in 4_40_mthole_fat.fp
** DONE Submit board to Sierra
* TODO Work on USB board [5/5]
** DONE Fill kit 14 for two boards
** DONE Make sure all parts have vendor entries
** DONE Create a "boards" category for symbols
   - Circuit boards will go in here.
*** TODO Move the boxcom circuit board to this directory, replace it in the schematics
** DONE Create a "pcb_features" category for symbols
   - Things like mounting holes with big annular rings will go in here.
*** TODO Move the 4_40 mounting hole symbol to this directory, replace it in the schematics.
*** TODO Create the paste format for digikey
** DONE Fill kit 15 for four boards
*** DONE Create kit 15
*** DONE Digi-Key parts go into baggies
    DEADLINE: <2013-03-03 Sun>
** TODO Fill kit 15a for 1 board (from kit 15)
* TODO Work on functional drawing [1/2]
  - Functional drawing is [[file:implement/drawings/functional.fig][here]].
** DONE Add current monitor
** TODO Use functional drawing to name schematic pages
* DONE Work on mechanical power switch [2/2]
** DONE Create schematic part for switch (21-1)
** DONE Create 4-pin mta100 footprint for switch.
   - The 4-pin header (14-12) is currently using the wrong footprint.  Modify the 2pin_mta100_pol.fp footprint to take 4 pins.  Follow instructions in the howto for modifying footprints.
* TODO Work on howto [1/1]
** DONE Write up how to do loopback test
** TODO Write up how to wire up Butterfly [1/2]
*** DONE Redraw Butterfly in inkscape for clipart
*** TODO Make a drawing with arrows showing where connectors get soldered
* TODO Plan using taskjuggler
