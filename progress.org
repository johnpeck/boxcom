* ----------------------- Dated notes ---------------------------
** <2012-10-07 Sun> Created this project
* --------------------- Specifications --------------------------
** Power outputs: +3.3V, +/15V at 100mA
** Module name programmable with remote command
** Non-volatile voltage input calibration
* ------------------------ TODO list ----------------------------
* TODO Post to geda-user about gschem issues on apone
** I'm having trouble selecting text, and text isn't redrawn until I explicitly ask for a redraw.
   - I wonder if there's a good way to assess the "state" of the geda installation, so that the developers have a beter idea of what I'm working with.
* TODO Receive eval232r boards
** Ordered from Digi-Key on <2012-10-07 Sun>
   - Scheduled to ship via UPS 3-day
* DONE Create a schematic part for ft232rl
** Part has a 3.3V LDO regulator broken out to pin 17.
   - Can source 50mA.
* DONE Create a schematic part for keystone 621 bracket
* TODO Fix capacitor value for USB power -- make sure Butterfly boots
* TODO Create a schematic part for trs202e -- rs232 transceiver
** The TI part is trs202ecd for 16-SOIC parts
** TODO Use luciani's SOIC-127P-600L1-16N footprint
